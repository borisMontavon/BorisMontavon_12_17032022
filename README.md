## Prepare the API

Go to this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard) and clone it on your computer.

Once you cloned it, run the following scripts : \

Install the yarn dependencies (if already done, go directly to the next command) :
`yarn`

Run the micro API :
`yarn dev`

**Note: you can run all these commands in the integreted terminal of your IDE or from a Bash/PowerShell**

After that, the API is ready to be used !

## Prepare the SportSee project

Once the project is cloned to your computer, open it in your IDE.

### Scripts

First, you will need to move to the `sportsee` folder : \
`cd sportsee`

Then, you will need to install all the `node_modules` : \
`npm ci`

To finish, you just need to launch the app on the selected localhost :
`npm start`
**Note: since the API use the 3000 localhost, we set a custom host to avoid conflicts. Feel free to change it if already used !**
